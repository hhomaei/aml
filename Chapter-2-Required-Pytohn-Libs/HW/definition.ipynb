    "### Part 1: Data Generation with Numpy\n",
    "1. Create two arrays of random normaly distributed values representing scores of two exams (midterm and final) for 100 students. Assume that all the scores are between 0 and 100.\n",
    "2. Create an array of 500 random normaly distributed values representing assignment scores (5 assignments for 100 students, each between 0 and 100). Then, reshape this array to have 100 rows and 5 columns.\n",
    "3. Create an array of random choices for a categorical variable (e.g., 'Department') from ['CS', 'EE', 'PHYS', 'CHEM', 'BIO'] for each student.\n",
    "4. Introduce some missing values (NaN) in randomly created arrays (i.e. midterm, final, assignments, and departments). After this step, 5 percent of the data should be NANs. For example, you can randomly specify some indices and replace the values of these indices with NaNs. A sample code for this step is as follows:"

    "A: 90-100, B: 80-89, C: 70-79, D: 60-69, F: <60.\n",
